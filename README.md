**Objective:** 
The primary objective is to predict the output value y based on two input features x1 and x2 using a basic neural network model with the equation y=3x1+4x2. The neural network will be trained using a feed-forward and back-propagation
mechanism to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.


**Methodology:**
1. Activation Functions
2. Sample Data
3. Feed Forward
4. Error Calculation
5. Back Propagation
6. Training
7. Visualization

**Expected Outcome:**
After sufficient training, the predicted ypred should be close to the actual value
yactual=17. The error graph should show a declining trend, indicating that the
model is learning and improving its predictions over time.
